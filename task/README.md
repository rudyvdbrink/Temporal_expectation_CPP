# Behavioral task for van den Brink et al (2019)

To run the task, run task.m in the folder 'scripts'.

This will prompt an input dialogue where you can set participant number, task (1 = detection, 2 = discrimination), EEG (1 = send triggers, 0 = no triggers), subject age, subject gender, screen width (in cm), and viewing distance (in cm).

Behavioral data are saved per individual block as a tab separated text file, and with all blocks concatinated as a matlab .mat file. 

Output matrix 'data' has 10 columns, with the following variables:
- 1)  trial number within block
- 2)  block number
- 3)  condition (see below)
- 4)  target position (1, left; -1, right)
- 5)  stimulus difficulty
- 6)  RT in seconds
- 7)  response code
- 8)  accuracy (correct or incorrect, 1 or 0)
- 9)  false alarm (yes or no, 1 or 0)
- 10) time on block
- 11) cue number (1 = low, 2 = high)

Condition information: First number (short/long); Second number (valid/invalid); Third number (easy/difficult).

- 10 = catch 
- 100 = short interval, validly cued, easy.
- 101 = short interval, validly cued, difficult.
- 110 = short interval, invalidly cued, easy.
- 111 = short interval, invalidly cued, difficult.
- 200 = long interval, validly cued, easy.
- 201 = long interval, validly cued, difficult.
- 210 = long interval, invalidly cued, easy.
- 211 = long interval, invalidly cued, difficult.


EEG trigger information:

stimulus markers:
 - trial start is indicated by trigger same as condition+30 (see above).
 - 6: cue onset
 - target onset is indicated by trigger condition (see above)

response marker:
 - 7: key press

feedback triggers:
  - 1 = hit trial
  - 2 = miss tiral
  - 3 = false alarm on catch trial
  - 4 = false alarm on non-cath trial
  - 5 = correct reject trial

block markers:
- 60 = start of real task (presented after the practice is complete)
